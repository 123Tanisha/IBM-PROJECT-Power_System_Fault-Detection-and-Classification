# IBM PROJECT-Power_System_Fault-Detection-and-Classification

## Problem Statement: 
<p>Design a machine learning model to detect and classify different types of faults in a power distribution system. Using electrical measurement data (e.g., voltage and current phasors), the model should be able to distinguish between normal operating conditions and various fault conditions (such as line-to-ground, line-to-line, or three-phase faults). The objective is to enable rapid and accurate fault identification, which is crucial for maintaining power grid stability and reliability. </p>
